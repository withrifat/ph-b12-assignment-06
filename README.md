## Question Answer Part 

1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?  
=> **var**: old, function scope. **let**: new, block scope, can change. **const**: block scope, can't reassign.  

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?  
=> **map**: makes a new array with changed values. **forEach**: just loops, no return array. **filter**: makes a new array with items that pass a test.  

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?  
=> Short way to write functions in ES6, and handle `this` differently in some cases.  

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?  
=> Quickly take values from arrays or objects.  

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?  
=> Use backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes. They allow `${}` for variables and multi-line strings, which is clearer than before and also faster.
